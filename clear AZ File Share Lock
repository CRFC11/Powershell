#This cannot be done with the GUI so PowerShell or Cloud Shell must be used.

#If you do not have the Azure powershell module installed, install it with

Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber 
#Accept and install any missing pre-requisites (i.e. NuGet)
 
#Connect to Azure and login with an admin account of sufficient privileges

Connect-AzAccount
 
#Select the subscription of the target account

Select-AzSubscription -subscriptionid "SubscriptionID"
#The Subscription ID is shown within the Overview page under the Storage Account you are connecting to


 
#Create storage context for the target storage account

$Context = New-AzStorageContext -StorageAccountName "StorageAccountName" -StorageAccountKey "StorageAccessKey"
#The storage account name and storage access key can be obtained from Settings > Access Keys within the Storage Account


 
#Get the current open handles of the file share

Get-AzStorageFileHandle -Context $Context -ShareName "FileShareName" -Recursive
#The file share name can be confirmed within the file shares



#This will return a list of open files within the share and the file you are having trouble with should be shown.

#Copy the path to the file in question.

#Close the open handle

Close-AzStorageFileHandle -Context $Context -ShareName "FileShareName" -Path 'path to file copied from the list' -CloseAll

#Re-run the open handles command to verify it has closed, you should now be able to delete it.
